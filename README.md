## Projects
Most of my work is on non-public projects. However, I am working on [CrowdChord](https://crowdchord.com), which is available to the public.

CrowdChord lets communities create collaborative Spotify playlists by voting songs in and out.
The project is currently closed source, but I plan to open source it in the future.
